These were projects I did with the Star Editor during my college years.
I mainly did these for fun and as a learning experience.
I was trying to get closer to what it would be like to becoming a developer.
The languages I worked in this was C++ and XML.
The most notable projects I did was Bloodsport, Star Shooter Defense and StrikeCraft.
