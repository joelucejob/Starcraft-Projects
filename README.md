These were projects I did with the Star Editor during my college years.

I mainly did these for fun and as a learning experience.

I was trying to get closer to what it would be like to becoming a developer.

The languages I worked in this was C++ and XML.

The most notable projects I did was Bloodsport, Star Shooter Defense and StrikeCraft.
